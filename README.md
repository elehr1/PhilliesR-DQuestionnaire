# PhilliesR-DQuestionnaire

DESCRIPTION

This project is inteded to look at a new technology the Philadelphia Phillies are evaluating to use to measure the spin rate
of pitches. The Research and Development department's goal is to have the new technology be comparable in accuracy to the 
current baseline technology employed. Through an in-depth analysis, I have advice the department to not pursue this
new technology.
