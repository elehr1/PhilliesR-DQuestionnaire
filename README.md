# PhilliesR-DQuestionnaire

DESCRIPTION

This project is inteded to look at a new technology the Philadelphia Phillies are evaluating to use to measure the spin rate
of pitches. The Research and Development department's goal is to have the new technology be comparable in accuracy to the 
current baseline technology employed. Through an in-depth analysis, I have advised the department to not pursue this
new technology. 

GETTING STARTED

Pull the data from the Original Data file into R Studio. You can do this by first pulling the data into Excel, and then importing the dataset from Excel into R Studio. 

PREREQUISITES

You will need to install the packages "readxl" and "ggplot2", in order to properly run the code. 
First run the function install.packages("readxl"), then activate the package through the function library(readxl). 
This will activate the package and allow you to use it properly. Repeat the steps above for the package "ggplot2". 

RUNNING CODE

To run the code, click the tab "Run" with a green arrow next to it to run each line of code. After each line is ran, be sure to look at the information it produces.
